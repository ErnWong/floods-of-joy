# Floods of Joy

A PROS Vex Robotics Program that *"floods"* the serial port with the *joy*-stick values.

Format:

```
[Ch1] [Ch2] [Ch3] [Ch4] [Btn5U] [Btn5D] [Btn6U] [Btn6D] [Btn7U] [Btn7D] [Btn7L] [Btn7R] [Btn8U] [Btn8D] [Btn8L] [Btn8R]
```

For example:

```
0 0 127 -34 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
```

To compile and download: `pros mu`

To open the terminal: `pros terminal`

Tip: be super powered with the knowledge that you can [pipe](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/30759/whats-a-good-example-of-piping-commands-together) stuff like the output of `pros terminal` to other programs in the command line, whether you're using windows or linux or apple.

Enjoy!
